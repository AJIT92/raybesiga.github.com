        <p class="post__desc left">Timor-Leste's first mHealth project was started with the goal of putting health in the hands of mothers. Liga Inan is using mobile phones to connect expectant mothers with health providers in Timor-Leste to improve the likelihood of a healthy pregnancy and birth.</p>

        <p class="post__desc left">In order to better enable health workers and midwives for their duties, the program sought to build an app stimuate engagement. This would be achieved by facilitating follow up of expectant mothers and tracking health facility general performance. Interviews with health workers and program knowledge from trend analysis led to focus on birth messaging and notifications by SMS and calls, tracking birth types, and showing health workers a dashboard overview with statistics related to their facility.  </p> 

        <p class="post__desc left">Given the poor cell coverage and meager bandwidth, we designed a progressive mobile web app that is offline first but allows for intuitive phone and web actions, animations and micro interactions over a basic Android phone interface. The development of Liga Inan Mobile is presently continuous.</p>


        <p class="post__desc left">More information about Liga Inan can be found <a href="http://ligainan.org/" target="_blank">here</a>. A demo of the product design work on the mobile app can be provided upon request.</p>
