    <p>Hi. I'm Ray Besiga, a digital product thinker, designer and engineer. I straddle the intersection between technology and design to create the best possible experiences for users across digital media. I am currently leading Product Design for <a href="http://urb.sparkpl.ug" target="_blank">Urb</a>, a civic engagement platform for non-emergency service requests in urban areas in developing countries. Previously, I was User Interface and Experience Engineer at <a href="http://catalpa.io/" target="_blank">Catalpa</a> in Timor-Leste. </p>

    <p>GOOD Magazine recognized me as one of the <a href="http://www.good.is/projects/the100/profiles/ray-besiga" target="_blank">Top 100 2014</a>. The next year, TEDx Kampala selected me to talk about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUmFRwvnosc" target="_blank">Technology and the Sharing Economy</a> under the theme, Owning Our Destiny. Was pretty stoked. It was also the year we launched Uganda's crowdfunding platform, <a href="http://akabbo.ug" target="_blank">Akabbo</a>. A wonderful exercise in user centered design.</p>

    <p>I like to surround myself with people that invigorate my aptitude for learning and the sparring of ideas. Traveling provides the same thrill.
