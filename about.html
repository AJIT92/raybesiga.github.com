    <p>Hi. Iâ€™m Raymond Besiga aka Ray Besiga, a product engineer and designer. I'm a Front-End User Experience Engineer at <a href="http://catalpa.io/" target="_blank">Catalpa</a>, a people first design & development organization based in Timor-Leste. Before that, I co-founded and ran <a href="http://sparkpl.ug">Sparkplug</a> for 3 years, designing and developing web and mobile apps for clients around the world.</p>

    <p>GOOD Magazine recognized me as one of the <a href="http://www.good.is/projects/the100/profiles/ray-besiga" target="_blank">Top 100 2014</a>. The next year, TEDx Kampala selected me to talk about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUmFRwvnosc" target="_blank">Technology and the Sharing Economy</a> under the theme, Owning Our Destiny. Was pretty stoked. It was also the year we launched Uganda's crowdfunding platform, <a href="http://akabbo.ug" target="_blank">Akabbo</a>. A wonderful exercise in user centered design.</p>

    <p>I like to surround myself with people that invigorate my aptitude for learning and the sparring of ideas. Traveling provides the same thrill.</p>
