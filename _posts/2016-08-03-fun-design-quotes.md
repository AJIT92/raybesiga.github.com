[John Cleese maintains that](http://www.fastcocreate.com/1680999/4-lessons-in-creativity-from-john-cleese) it is necessary to allow for contemplative thinking. 

A couple of days ago, I read an article on the Invision blog titled [72 quotes about design and creativity](http://blog.invisionapp.com/design-and-creativity-quotes/). That is a whole lot of quotes by any means but there were quite a few that really stuck. Here goes:

<blockquote>There is no such thing as a boring project. There are only boring executions - Irene Etzkorn</blockquote>

<blockquote>Great design is a multi-layered relationship between human life and its environment - Naoto Fukasawa</blockquote>


<blockquote>As we decrease uncertainty, we give ourselves permission to increase fidelity - Jonathan Irwin</blockquote>

<blockquote>Put hot triggers in the path of motivated people - B.J. Fogg</blockquote>

<blockquote>I have several times made a poor choice by avoiding a necessary confrontation - John Cleese</blockquote>

<blockquote>If you’re not prepared to be wrong, you’ll never come up with anything original - Sir Ken Robinson</blockquote>

<blockquote>Design is a solution to a problem. Art is a question to a problem - John Maeda</blockquote>

<blockquote>Design is an opportunity to continue telling the story, not just to sum everything up - Tate Linden</blockquote>


I'd have loved to provide commentary on each one but they self elaborate. What are some great quotes about design and making that you've encountered?
