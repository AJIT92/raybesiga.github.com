It's a beautiful weekend, sun is out and glad to be back in Kampala. Been meaning to write for a while, if only for the catharsis, but there is so much to write about I do not know where to start. However, I decided to write about the reason I ended in Florence in the first place. [Pitti Immagine Uomo](http://www.pittimmagine.com/en/corporate/fairs/uomo/news/2014/opening86.html)!

Pitti Immagine Uomo, a key international trade event showcasing men’s fashions and contemporary lifestyle trends is a big deal that I had never heard of until my great friend and rising jaggernaut in the Men's Fashion accessories industry, Adrian Azodi, founder of [Monsieur Fox](http://www.monsieurfox.com/) extended an invite. It was an incredible event showcasing excellence of the makers of exclusive products, brands that have redefined men's fashion, special projects presented by leading international designers and new talent.

I am a rookie or otherwise totally clueless person when it comes to fashion. I know nothing about the workings of the fashion industry but decided to head out into the unknown anyway. See what it's about. However, I was not ready for the spectacle that I witnessed.

It was the utimate showcase, not just in fashion, but in personal and professional branding. From men's wear of tomorrow.

Now, the Pitti Uomo, in Florence, is dubbed the most complete, innovative and market-oriented presentation of for men’s fashions but that definitely did not leave the women out. They stole the thunder, IMHO, as always! Donning super chic dresses..
